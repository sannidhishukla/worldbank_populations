  Through its Indicators API, the World Bank gives access to a wealth of data on different parts of the world. This data is separated by region (these regions can be anything from a country to, say, the group of countries that the World Bank defines as being part of the 'Middle East' or any other larger region of the world to the world at large) and by the year in which it was collected.

  In particular, here I work with population data sorted by age and sex to create visualizations (population pyramids) of the age-sex structure of different regions around the world in different years. I also work with dtaa concerning the urban/rural populations in different regions and the GDP per capita. I ultimately look to find a relationship between how urbanized a society is and its age-sex structure.

  My work here was greatly facilitated by Oliver Schrouse's wbdata library which I've provided a link to in my notebook. I hope you enjoy looking around and that by using the interactive tools available in the notebook you are able to generate some insights of your own. :)
